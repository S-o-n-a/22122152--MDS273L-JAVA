This flow chart of Lab-2 in which it was said to create a menu-driven program where the menu options are :
1.Enter a name
2.Search for a name
3.Remove a name
4.Show all names
It was also said that it should made with do-while loop and switch-case statements
here we started with giving the user input arraylist and later on creating choices using do and later on using switch-case statements and while loop we get a menu-driven program.

This is the flow chart of Lab-3 in which it was said to the program which should collect an integer array for which we should be given along with choices of mean, median and mode using user input and functions.
here we started the user who is giving inputs which includes the array length and elements then later on a menu is created which consist of mean,median and mode. From that we later on move to cases which is created using switch and at last we return the values of mean,median and mode.
